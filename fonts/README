This directory contains the fonts used throughout the document (free fonts,
released under the OFL license).

On a Linux system, just extract the files in the ~/.fonts directory.
On other systems, follow the usual font installation procedure.
After installation, XeLaTeX should be able to find the fonts and compile the file.

Fonts:
* Inconsolata http://www.levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html
* Linux Libertine http://www.linuxlibertine.org/index.php?id=91&L=1
