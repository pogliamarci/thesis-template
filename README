This is the (unofficial) template I used and customised for my Masterâ€™s Thesis
at Politecnico di Milano.

The template is loosely based upon a previous template by Filippo Sironi (I
leave his readme as is below), and the Ph.D. Thesis template by Federico Maggi
(github.com/phretor) released under
http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/.

This is not actually a real template, but just a skeleton (i.e., preamble.tex
is supposed to be edited when using the template...).

The template is meant to be used with XeLaTex: the fonts used are provided in
the fonts/ directory.
To use the standard Latex, remove the font definition from the preamble and add
the correct inputenc package (e.g. \usepackage{utf8x}[inputenc]).

PS: The Makefile requires GNU awk (gawk) to sort the abbreviations
